According to Datadog, over 80% of organizations are using container orchestration tool if they are in production and Kubernetes is the leading choice for these enterprises.

We have created the world's best zero trust security and continuous compliance solution for Kubernetes platforms. We have some of the smartest engineers on the planet who are building an incredible solution for a really complex problem. Some of the largest enterprises have embraced our technology as they are building out their container platforms. We power a majority of the Kubernetes clusters around the planet with our Network Security solution.    To help these customers succeed, we are building a world-class Customer Success team and are looking for technical rock stars with a passion for designing and deploying technical solutions based on cutting-edge technology. You will lead the charge to operationalize one of our core values - \u201cOur customer is the Hero of our story\u201d.

In your role as a Senior Solutions Architect, you will engage with our customers and users to help them design and architect a secure Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform powered by Kubernetes. You will provide thought leadership, guide customers and partners towards implementation of best practices, and provide ongoing technical guidance and consulting during steady state operations.    And you will have a unique opportunity to learn, develop and grow your Kubernetes skills from the best Kubernetes experts that you can find, all while having the experience of a lifetime.

Bozeman High has been ranked on Newsweek's top-schools list five times since 2003. Seventy-four percent of the community's 41,000 residents have some post-secondary education. University graduates, along with industry-experienced newcomers seeking a higher quality of life, provide a brain pool for the area's mix of expanding businesses.    Because of its access to some of the best ski mountains in the United States, SKI Magazine has ranked Bozeman as the #4 ski town in the country. Powder Magazine ranked Bozeman in the 'top 32 ski towns in North America' and National Geographic, placed Bozeman in the 'World's 25 Best Ski Towns.' In addition, Outside Magazine has ranked Bozeman as the 5th best college town in the United States and ranks the city 15th in the United States for access to outside sports. This active outdoor lifestyle is coupled with a strong work ethic that has enabled Bozeman to rank number one as a business climate among cities under 100,000 in the United States, by American City Business Journals.    With tons of great cultural events including museums, symphony, opera, and a vibrant live music scene as well as the great outdoors, it isn't what to do in Bozeman, but what not to do because there are so many activities-snow or sunshine.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we\u2019re \u201cold\u201d (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we\u2019re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do \u2013 you can\u2019t put us in a box!    But \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)    Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We hear from our customers every day that when an organization understands itself better it can create more fulfilling jobs, and grow in ways never before imagined.    Enterprises big and small trust our products to provide visibility and clarity in areas once characterized by hearsay and uncertainty. With the insights delivered by Peakon, these organizations become more agile, responsive, and able to make the changes and investments that their employees care about most.    We\u2019re in the business of creating great places to work, so it should be no surprise that this is our highest priority at Peakon. With ambitions as big as ours, we see individual growth and development as the key strategy for growing our business.    Trust and transparency guide everything we do here. You\u2019ll find an open salary model, unlimited vacation, minimal hierarchy, and maximum freedom to develop and execute your own ideas. Our style of collaboration is based on honesty and friendship, and we always love making new friends...    Who you are    A Sales Enablement professional who believes their job is a vital role to increasing the efficiency of the Sales Org from onboarding to ongoing training. Someone with both a technical and personal mindset, this person will be able to analyze sometimes complex data sets in our CRM (SFDC) as well as own our Sales Enablement and Marketing Automation platform (Showpad) to understand in detail the different facets of product updates and releases, all while being able to communicate those details to the Sales team in a concise way so they in turn can communicate those points to our customers. This role will be responsible for developing and maintaining our \u2018sales playbook\u2019 while also coaching reps on how to use our Sales Tool kit so thriving in the Presentation setting at the leadership level is also a must. The Sales Enablement Manager will be a Strategic part of our Sales Org, working closely with the Sales and Customer Success leadership teams to develop messaging around Marketing and Product releases but also providing much needed bandwidth coverage to those leaders so you will ideally have a collaborative mindset around how to work with all teams involved. In this role you will focus on increasing the effectiveness of the Sales Organization so you will ideally be well versed in SaaS, selling to C-Level and Sales process & methodology.    The Why     As the Peakon Sales Team continues to grow globally we must continue to invest in and develop our people. As the face of Peakon in the Market, Sales reps should be knowledgeable, trustworthy and confident.   We must create a system where our teams can continue to grow with both external and internal hires, being able to join and contribute in as little time as possible accounting for growth and attrition.   As Peakon expands into new products and markets, information changes rapidly and this information must be delivered in clear and concise mediums while absorption of knowledge is measured and reported on.   Sales Management does not have the ability to be involved in all aspects of development and product messaging so Sales Enablement is required to build a strong connection between the goals of management and the facilitation of ongoing adaptation of Sales Reps.     Requirements     Facilitate the onboarding and ongoing training of new Sales Reps and Support by developing and maintaining our Sales playbook while also guiding reps on how to use our Sales tool kit.   Work alongside the Sales and Customer Success leadership teams to develop messaging around Marketing and Product updates and releases in order to provide direction to reps as to how those updates should be communicated.    Own and develop our Sales Presentation template, joining calls and meetings where necessary in order to fully understand our sales process and customer profile.   From a technical standpoint, own and optimize our Sales Enablement and Marketing Automation platform (Showpad), as well as support coaching on data from our CRM (SFDC) to support close plans and account reviews.

Over the past thirty years NACA has established a track record that has earned both the respect and fear from others in the lending industry. NACA stands out in the following areas: 1) It is the most effective organization in the country in providing affordable homeownership; 2) It is the place to work to fight for economic justice for those dedicated and willing to work hard; and 3) It provides unprecedented opportunities for staff to do well financially by doing good.   Started in 1988, NACA has won campaigns against some of the country\u2019s most powerful companies and individuals that engaged in predatory and discriminatory lending. NACA\u2019s success is a result of its aggressive, confrontational advocacy and state-of-the-art systems and operations. The purchase program provides comprehensive counseling as HUD\u2019s largest housing counseling agency (through its Neighborhood Stabilization Corporation subsidiary) with access to NACA\u2019s Best in America mortgage: no down payment, no closing costs, no requirement for perfect credit and always at a below-market, fixed interest rate. NACA has over $15 billion in mortgage commitments from the country\u2019s largest lenders to support this program. Through its HomeSave program for homeowners with an unaffordable mortgage, NACA is also the most effective in providing affordable solutions and has done so for over 250,000 at-risk homeowners nationwide.   Built on this track record of success, NACA is undertaking rapid expansion across the country with the hiring of many additional staff nationwide. NACA continues its aggressive advocacy in fighting for economic justice for low- to moderate-income people and communities. In addition to affordable homeownership, NACA takes on economic justice issues such as student debt, tax equity, income inequality, environmental and other issues. Employees at NACA have a tremendous impact on the communities and the Members they serve. For more information about NACA, its history and programs, visit www.naca.com.       NACA COUNSELOR   A NACA Counselor (\u201cCounselor\u201d) can be either a Housing Counselor (\u201cHC\u201d) or Mortgage Counselor (\u201cMC\u201d). The expectation is that one would begin as a HC and become an MC within six months of employment. The exception would be in the Charlotte Counseling Center where conversion to an MC is encouraged but not required. A NACA Counselor provides comprehensive, individual, face-to-face housing and budgeting counseling services in a local NACA office or by phone and video conferencing from the Charlotte Counseling Center to Members in NACA\u2019s Purchase Program. The focus is on low- and moderate-income individuals and minorities who have been locked out of affordable homeownership. The Counselor helps homebuyers overcome the roadblocks that prevent them from purchasing a home. This consists of individual counseling to qualify for NACA\u2019s Best in America mortgage. The Counselor must be an advocate who provides comprehensive counseling and affordable outcomes. Additional counseling is provided to homeowners with an unaffordable mortgage through NACA\u2019s HomeSave program.   NACA is likely the only job in the counseling and mortgage industry where an employee can provide many low and moderate-income borrowers and those locked out of affordable homeownership with an incredible mortgage while also earning considerable income. The NACA mortgage and homeownership program are so superior that they require minimal marketing efforts. NACA provides an instant pipeline of homebuyers without the need to generate leads which allows the Counselor to be dedicated to helping their Members take control of their finances and prepare them for homeownership with the NACA Mortgage.   The Counselor is the Member\u2019s primary point of contact through NACA Qualification and is responsible for adhering Members to NACA\u2019s established requirements. The MC is a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator and continues to be the primary point of contact through bank application and closing. Whether an HC or an MC, the Counselor manages his/her own pipeline of Members while working within the underwriting guidelines for NACA\u2019s Best in America Mortgage program. S/he ensures effective and timely communication, explains and requests necessary documents, and determines readiness for homeownership and an affordable mortgage payment for each Member. The Counselor also works with the Member to address and improve their financial management.   When a Member decides to seek the NACA mortgage product, only the MC can assist them in securing a NACA mortgage or engage in other mortgage origination activities regarding a mortgage application for a specific property. The NACA Mortgage Department is primarily responsible for processing and closing the loan. Their activities include addressing lender conditions, obtaining title and homeowners insurance. The MC can assist in addressing conditions and other activities to facilitate the Member in a timely manner without conflicting with the Mortgage Department\u2019s activities.   The HC, whose duties exclude mortgage origination activities, is not required to be licensed through the National Mortgage Licensing System as a Mortgage Loan Originator (\u201cMLO\u201d) when beginning employment. The HC hired in a local NACA office, other than the Charlotte Counseling Center, is expected to transition to a MC within six (6) months of employment. In such a transition, NACA will reimburse a HC who becomes a MC the cost of a continuing education course, a federal and state test fee, and clearing a fingerprint and a background check to become licensed through NMLS. The MC compensation is significantly higher than a HC.   JOB RESPONSIBILITIES:   The Counselor provides comprehensive housing counseling to pre-approve a homebuyer for the NACA Mortgage or other mortgages (\u201cNACA Qualification\u201d). The Counselor utilizes NACA\u2019s state-of-the-art content management software called NACA-Lynx that enables paperless housing counseling and mortgage processing. So that Counselors can save time and focus on meaningful interactions, the Member is provided with their own Web-file for uploading documents, data inputting, status updates and much more. Through NACA-Lynx the Counselor assesses the Members readiness for homeownership with a realistic purchase price for their desired area and works with the Member to become NACA Qualified. This requires full documentation based on NACA\u2019s policies and procedures. For some Members, this can be achieved quickly while for others it may take several months or more. The Counselor essentially underwrites the Member based on NACA\u2019s character based and compensating factor underwriting policies. A NACA Underwriter in the Mortgage Department or Director of the local office reviews the Counselor\u2019s determination to make the final decision on whether the Member should be NACA Qualified or requires additional counseling or documentation.   The Counselor maintains a professional demeanor and provides outstanding customer service at all times. The Counselor educates the Member on his/her next steps at each stage of the process and utilizes problem solving skills and excellent budget guidance in order to provide sound counseling and help the Member overcome obstacles. S/he must be able to work independently with Members. The Counselor must also have the ability to manage time effectively so that they complete effective counseling sessions within specified time limits and in an accurate manner. Counselors should prioritize ready Members and effectively manage their pipeline and scheduled calendars.   On day to day basis, the specific job responsibilities of a Counselor include the following:     Provide clear direction for a path towards homeownership. Work with Members to improve their financial management.   Work with NACA\u2019s software to accurately complete documentation and data entry for efficient and paperless qualification.   Write narrative analyses and action plans to document next steps after each counseling session.   Qualify Members by reviewing payment history, liabilities and other credit information.   Work with Members to develop an affordable budget and address budget issues through comprehensive financial counseling   Work with Members to save minimum required funds to make the home purchase.   Work with the Member to calculate a monthly surplus to demonstrate that the Member can afford a higher mortgage payment over the long term.   Examine and process documents, addressing issues as needed.   Determine readiness for homeownership based on NACA\u2019s Qualification Criteria: eligibility, readiness, affordability, funds and compliance.   Determine a maximum affordable mortgage payment and purchase price.   Address NACA Qualification conditions (if any) within 24 hours.   Educate the Member about alternative mortgage products or solutions for Member to feel comfortable with their mortgage decision.     Mortgage Origination (limited to MC):     Stay in contact with the NACA Qualified Member to ensure the Member maintains the parameters under which they were NACA Qualified while searching for a property and maintain an up-to-date file in the NACA-Lynx system.   Assist Members during the housing search to purchase a home in his/her desired community.   Provide property specific letters.   Review and process Member\u2019s application for NACA Credit Access (i.e. verification that the Member meets the underwriting criteria).   Submit Member\u2019s mortgage application.   Fulfill tasks that require origination licensing (discuss change of circumstances, loan updates, etc.).   Assists the Member through closing as appropriate to facilitate the mortgage process.     Advocacy in support of NACA\u2019s Mission:   Employment with NACA requires ongoing participation in NACA\u2019s advocacy, outreach, community organizing, and other activities as determined by NACA. S/he needs to support and defend the organization\u2019s philosophy, tactics and advocacy. Such participation in and support of NACA\u2019s confrontational advocacy campaigns and other activities is important in achieving NACA\u2019s mission of advocating for economic justice and expanding NACA\u2019s Best in America Mortgage and homeownership program. While these activities may impact Performance Pay compensation, they are crucial for NACA\u2019s continued success and for meeting NACA\u2019s mission.   Other Activities:     Present Home Buyer Workshops.   Assist in outreach activities focused on low and moderate income communities, churches and job sites.   Engage in regular trainings   Obtain and maintain HUD certification   Other duties as assigned     TIME DEMANDS:   Approximately 45 to 50+ hours weekly and as necessary to meet the demands of the job. Typical working hours are: 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. weekdays, a late night(s), plus approximately a half-day two weekends every month for the Qualification/Homebuyer Workshops and/or counseling. Other than required additional time, voluntary overtime is approved based on the Counselor\u2019s productivity and counseling demands with more flexibility provided to MCs. During NACA\u2019s Events (which are usually five days each including weekends) and other campaign activities, the Counselor may be required to work increased hours at NACA\u2019s sole discretion.       COMPENSATION     The compensation consists of the Base Pay, Performance Pay and Monthly Bonus. NACA does not permit any NACA staff to charge the Member or others for any service provided, nor to add any product to the loan or do anything else to increase compensation. The Base Pay provides a minimum \u201ccash-flow\u201d each pay period to compensate for outreach, NACA\u2019s advocacy campaigns and other activities that may reduce the time available for obtaining Performance Pay. Compensation for events, which the Counselor may be required to participate, may be different than that stated herein as determined in NACA\u2019s sole discretion. Performance Pay is paid if the Counselor is actively employed at the time the Member closes on their NACA Mortgage. The Monthly Bonus is paid if the Counselor is actively employed at the end of the month of the monthly bonus period.   Performance Pay is significantly higher for those in greatest need for the program. These are the Targeted Members who are low- to moderate-income individuals and Members purchasing in Targeted Areas which are low- to moderate-income areas. NACA is committed to providing at least 70% of its mortgages to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities.       Targeted Members:  Members whose income is less than 80% of the median income in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (\u201cMSA\u2019s\u201d) area where the Member purchases.     Targeted Areas:  Properties in a census tract where the tract medium family income percentage is less than 80% of the MSA.     MORTGAGE COUNSELOR:   The total compensation is structured so a MC can earn an overall compensation from $60,000 to $100,000+. This expectation is based on 5 to 10+ closings a month.

Base Pay:   Hourly wage rate of $10.00, greater if required by law, plus any overtime (\u201cBase Pay\u201d).   Performance Pay:   Complete Process - Closed NACA Mortgage being counseled and qualified by MC from initial intake through closing. Payment of one of the below three options:     Targeted Member: $850 per Closed NACA Mortgage   Target Area: $850 per Closed NACA Mortgage.   Non-Targeted Member or Area: $500 per Closed NACA Mortgage.     Partial Process - Closed NACA Mortgage initially qualified by another Counselor with housing search and mortgage processed by the MC:   Targeted Member and/or Targeted Area:     $400 per closed NACA Mortgage with P&S executed within six months of NACA Qualification.   $600 per closed NACA Mortgage with P&S executed greater than six months of NACA Qualification.     Non-Targeted Member or Area:     $300 per closed NACA Mortgage with P&S executed within six months of NACA Qualification.   $350 per closed loan with P&S executed greater than six months of NACA qualification.

Bonus:     $100 for each NACA Qualified Member closed that month.     HOUSING COUNSELOR:   The total compensation is structured so a HC can earn an overall compensation from $45,000 to $60,000+.   Base Pay:   Hourly wage rate of $15.00, greater if required by law, plus any overtime (\u201cBase Pay\u201d).   Performance Pay:   The HC initially NACA Qualifies the Member, the Member was not re-qualified by another Counselor, and the Member executes a Purchase & Sales contract within six months of the NACA Qualification and closes on that property with a NACA Mortgage. Payment on one of three below options.     Targeted Member: $250 per NACA Qualified Member with a closed loan.   Targeted Area: $250 per NACA Qualified Member (per NACA Qualified & closed loan).   Non-Targeted Member or Area: $150 per NACA Qualified Member (per NACA Qualified & closed loan).     Monthly Bonus Payment (must be actively employed at completion of bonus month):     Closes seven (7) or more Members with the NACA Mortgage excluding those with a Partial Process;   At least seventy percent (70%) or more are Targeted Members and/or Targeted Areas; and   Adhere to NACA\u2019s policies.     Bonus:   $50 for each NACA Qualified Member with a closed NACA Mortgage that month.    PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS   The Counselor is required to NACA Qualify a minimum of 8 Members per month with the majority for Targeted Members, perform a minimum of 15 counseling sessions per week, and submit bank applications within 10 days of an executed P&S Contract (MCs only). NACA, at its sole discretion, may adjust such requirements or add requirements for an individual Counselor(s) or more broadly.   The Counselor is required to provide comprehensive counseling that improves a Member\u2019s financial management including: accurate budget with documented expenses, increased savings, decreased debt, improved credit score, improved payment history, on-time rental payments after history of missing payments (thereby stabilizing current housing situation), or stopping over drafting after a history of NSF fees. These are some of the basics of good counseling that NACA monitors. This is required for all the Member s/he counsels regardless of whether they are NACA Qualified or eventually close on a property. The HC is not to work with Members once they have identified a property or are in the mortgage process, which would be in violation of mortgage licensing requirements.   NACA may grade the Counselor\u2019s counseling and submissions, obtain Member surveys, and perform other evaluations. NACA Performance Pay may be reduced, eliminated or shared as determined by NACA in its sole discretion may terminate the Counselor or the Performance Pay may be reduced or eliminated due not meeting performance requirements. These include but are not limited to: poor grades on submissions, issues identified by Member surveys, shared work, poor/ineffective counseling, inaccurate or incomplete submissions, missing timelines, not meeting above minimum requirements, not adhering to NACA\u2019s policies and procedures, or failing to meet other requirements or metrics.       JOB QUALIFICATIONS   NACA seeks leaders with a positive and open attitude, a strong work ethic and relentless commitment to success with attention to detail and ability to meet aggressive deadlines and ambitious goals. S/he is expected to have a high level of core competencies and skills included in one\u2019s personal characteristics and professional experiences in the following areas: communication, organizational skills, professional skills, professionalism, customer service, time management, positive leadership, computer skills and being mission-driven. The  Core Competencies & Skills  are described in detail at www.naca.com.
