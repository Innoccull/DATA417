What:  UCBZeroWaste / UsedCardboardBoxes.com (UCB) designs & manages large-scale Zero Waste Programs (including Return, Reuse, Resell, Recycle and Waste-to-Energy) .   How:  UCB pays large companies more than recycling rates for re-usable commodities and optimizes their traditional recyclables to create real financial value. That money can be applied to the Waste-to-Energy process\u2026 enabling large companies to get to \"Zero Waste to Landfill\" at minimal out-of-pocket cost.   Why:  By paying suppliers more than recycling, charging customers less than new packaging, reducing environmental impact, employing people US and making a profit\u2026  UCB's business model is a win/win/win/win/win .   When UCB launched in 2006, we built technology and designed processes that enabled UCB to buy used/empty boxes (and gaylord totes) from large US food, beverage and CPG manufactures, for more than recycling rates! These are the gaylord totes and shipping boxes they receive and unpack from their vendors (often carrying bulk food, ingredients, plastic bottles & caps, etc.). UCB can pay more than any recycler, because we don't recycle these boxes\u2026.  we RESELL them, as boxes ,  (mainly to major retailers for distribution and reverse logistics) right here in the US. As a closed-loop sustainability program,  we actually RETURN BOXES RIGHT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL VENDOR, for reuse! Our programs help separate valuable commodities to reduce waste and identify the most valuable outlet for each commodity.   Our programs have expanded and today we buy gaylord totes, shipping boxes, pallets, supersaks, barrels and drums\u2026 all for MORE than recycling rates\u2026 and resell them for less than new.   UCB has created a tremendous amount of value at many large companies ( Anheuser-Busch, Bayer, Burlington Coat, Family Dollar/Dollar Tree, Foot Locker, General Mills, Goodwill Industries, Keurig, Menards, McCormick Spice, P&G, Pepsi, Sports Authority/DICK's, Safeway/Albertsons, TJMaxx/Marshalls, Target, True Value, Walmart, and many more) as we are likely the largest buyer/seller of quality USED boxes in the country\u2026 and now manage almost any byproduct of food/bev/cpg manufacturing or distribution.   UCB's proprietary software is called WATER: Waste Analytics and Tracking for Environmental Reporting.   One thing that separates UCB from \"local box brokers\" and surely \"traditional recyclers\" and even \"waste consultants\" is our online, real-time tracking tools that report down to the SKU-level, allowing for continuous improvement programs. This keeps ALL of UCB's supplier's reuse, recycling and waste data in one place, for easy (and accurate) online, real-time reporting\u2026 at their fingertips! For UCB customers (who buy these used commodities), this same real-time data enables buyers to view inventory to see what meets their needs, compare used pricing to new pricing and even place orders online.

Providing guidance to all staff to ensure the customer experience is the main focus. By leading the sales team, the sales manager is responsible for achieving the locations sales and budget objectives and managing all store operations.     Our Story       Founded in October 2000, APEX Communications, LLC, is Arkansas\u2019s largest AT&T authorized retailer with 29 locations across Arkansas and 2 in Oklahoma. APEX is one of the fastest growing privately owned communications companies in the Southeast.     The APEX headquarters is based in Wynne, Arkansas, a typical Arkansas community, and is founded upon the Vision of \u201cBeing the BEST\u201d. This translates in the communication industry to \u201cbeing the BEST choice for customers in each market served\u201d. Or, put another way, \u201cto operate at the APEX of the Mountain of Success\u201d.     Everything we do, from the people we hire, to the customer service we deliver, is all geared around being the BEST!     As the leading AT&T authorized retailer in Arkansas, APEX provides the following services to the communities we serve:       AT&T wireless service for residential and commercial   AT&T wireline service for residential and commercial   AT&T Digital Life   AT&T Uverse TV   AT&T high speed internet, including Uverse   DirecTV       (Note that not all services are available in all areas).     APEX began with 3 stores in Wynne, Forrest City, and Jonesboro in 2000. In June 2006, the acquisition of 8 retail locations of Go Wireless in South Arkansas became the catalyst to a steady stream of acquisition and de novo growth. This resulted in APEX operating 13 locations at the end of 2006, 19 at the end of 2007, and 29 at the end of 2008. APEX added its 30th location in September 2009 before focusing its attention on implementing new software and business processes to better train our employees and serve our customers.     In 2010, APEX was a finalist for Arkansas Business of the Year in recognition of its growth and success. Later that year, APEX entered the Georgia market and expanded into Oklahoma in 2013. These acquisitions bring the total number of APEX stores to 38. In early 2014, APEX sold the Georgia location in order to focus on the Arkansas and Oklahoma markets.     APEX has committed with AT&T to remodel, expand or relocate our current locations in order to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. This growth has resulted in numerous efficiencies that benefit the CUSTOMER as it allows APEX to better deliver on its commitment to be the BEST by providing a wider range of product in a timely fashion at a great price for each community served.     APEX is actively involved in each community. The APEX shareholders were former principals in United Medical, a highly successful medical equipment company with 56 locations in 13 states, and brought over a foundational belief that \u201cPeople do business with People\u201d. We believe, even in this age of technology, that this is still true today. So, each location is involved in its local chamber of commerce and works to support its community. In addition, each location is staffed with local people that live, shop, and invest in that community.     APEX also believes it is \u201cBlessed to be a Blessing\u201d. As such, we work to give back. Each year, APEX conducts an \u201cAPEX Gives Back Christmas Campaign\u201d. APEX has partnered with When Will We Cry? Inc. to make a Christmas donation based upon every activation sold from Thanksgiving until Christmas each year.     Finally, APEX seeks to operate its business with Christian principles of Integrity and \u201cjust doing the right thing\u201d.
